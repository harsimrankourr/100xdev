ECMAScript 
it is a scripting language specification on which JavaScript is based.
It is standardized by ECMA international in the ECMA-262 and ISO/IEC 16262
document.
it serves as the guideline or the rules for scripting language design.
There are some things in ECMAScript that every JavaScript compiler should supoort 
There are many versions of ECMAScript.

JavaScript most widely known and used implementation of ECMAScript
JavaScript includes additional features that are not part of ECMAScript specification
like document object model(DOM) manipulation, which is crucial for web development
but is not defined by ECMAScript

like setTimeout, fs.readfile(These are from web API's)

What is JavaScript?

Common JS browser engines

1.V8 - used by google chrome - Common
  http://githhub.com/v8/v8

  v8 engine is an open source JavaScript engine developed by the chromium
  project for google chrome and chromium web browser. It's written in C++
  and is responsible for compiling JavaScript code into native machine code before executing
  it, which greatly improve performance.

2.SpiderMonkey - used by Firefox - C + rust
  https://spidermonkey.dev/

JavaScript was initially used for functionality  of a web on the brower 
JavaScript was only used in the browser 
for backend Java was used 

So why people should know two different languages?

so a runtime environment was required to execute javaScript outside the browser
It was node.js
===========================================================================================

What is node.js?

node.js isn't a language 
It is a runtime. 
It took out v8 engine.
It's writtenn in C C++
=======================================================================

What is Bun?

other than the fact that Js is single threaded,
Node.js is slow (multiple reason for it)
some smart people said they wanted to re-write 
the JS runtime for the backend and introduced Bun 

It is a significantly faster runtime 

It is written in Zig

https://github.com/over-sh/Bun

=======================================================================

What can you do with node.js?

    1. Creating Clis(COmmand line interfaces).
    2.Creating a video player
    3.Creating a game.
    4.Creating an HTTP server.

  =====================================================================

HTTP(Hyper text transfer Protocall)
    1.A Protocall that is defined for machines to communicate.
    2.specially for websites, it is the most common way for your websites 
      frontend to talk with the backend.

HTTP Protocol
things client needs to worried about
    1. Protocol(HTTP/HTTPS)
    2. Address(URL/IP/PORT)
    3. Route
    4. Header, body, Query parameters
    5. methods

things server needs to worry about 
    1. Response Header
    2. Response body
    3. Status code


protocol://URL/Route
https://chat.openai.com/backend-api/conversation

==================================================================================

1.Browser parses the URL
2.Does a DNS lookup(Domain name Service resolution)(Converts google.com to an IP)
3.Establish a connection to IP (does hanndshake)

-->>>>>  What is DNS resolution?

URL's are just like contacts in your phone
In the end they are map to an IP
If you ever buy a URL of your own, you will need to point it    
to the IP of your server.

===========================================================================

-->>>>>> things thet happen on your server after request is recieved

1. You get the inputs(route, body, headers)
2. You do some logics on the input, calculate the output.
3. You return the output body, headers and status code

============================================================================

What are the common methods you can send to your backend server?
    1. get
    2. POST
    3. PUT
    4. DELETE

============================================================================

What are the common status codes the backend responds with?
    1. 200 - Everything is ok
    2. 404 - Page/route not found
    3. 403 - Authentication issue
    4. 500 - Internal server error
