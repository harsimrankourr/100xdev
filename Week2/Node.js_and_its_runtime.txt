it is a scripting language specification on which JavaScript is based.
It is standardized by ECMA international in the ECMA-262 and ISO/IEC 16262
document.
it serves as the guideline or the rules for scripting language design.
There are some things in ECMAScript that every JavaScript compiler should supoort 
There are many versions of ECMAScript.

JavaScript most widely known and used implementation of ECMAScript
JavaScript includes additional features that are not part of ECMAScript specification
like document object model(DOM) manipulation, which is crucial for web development
but is not defined by ECMAScript

What is JavaScript?

Common JS browser engines

1.V8 - used by google chrome - Common
  http://githhub.com/v8/v8

  v8 engine is an open source JavaScript engine developed by the chromium
  project for google chrome and chromium web browser. It's written in C++
  and is responsible for compiling JavaScript code into native machine code before executing
  it, which greatly improve performance.

2.SpiderMonkey - used by Firefox - C + rust
  https://spidermonkey.dev/

JavaScript was initially used for functionality  of a web on the brower 
JavaScript was only used in the browser 
for backend Java was used 

So why people should know two different languages?

so a runtime environment was required to execute javaScript outside the browser
It was node.js
===========================================================================================

What is node.js?

node.js isn't a language 
It is a runtime. 
It took out v8 engine.
It's writtenn in C C++

What is Bun?

other than the fact that Js is single threaded,
Node.js is slow (multiple reason for it)
some smart people said they wanted to re-write 
the JS runtime for the backend and introduced Bun 

It is a significantly faster runtime 

It is written in Zig
